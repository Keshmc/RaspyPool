# RaspyPool
This RaspyPool project was implemented as an IDPA project of the Berufsmaturit√§tsschule St.Gallen. The Python program is designed for a Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB), 
but can be run on any computer. The Poolsteering can control the following devices:
- a filter pump
- a UVC filter 
- a heater
- a pH-Sensor from Atlas Scientific (USB)

To ensure the function of the steering, the hardware has to be rebuilt according to the Wiring Diagram and Dispo. We used the pH-Sample from Atlas Scientific. 
For more Information and Details to the Hardware and Software see the RaspyPool.docx.
